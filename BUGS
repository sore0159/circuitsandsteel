---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED: (Mostly) No options at snapshot gen
FIXED: Always faction1 win the coin flip?
FIXED: After losing match but before snapshot, last-hit not reset to proper place?
FIXED: Factions switch 'sides' of the board based on whos first in the turn order (snapshot load feature)
FIXED Tokens facing the wrong way after a match reset
FIXED Winning a match is bugged
FIXED When a card is used for aid it still may be counted as available for own defense (related to option tray creation timing)
FIXED 2 stacked attacking from left can call for aid, from right cannot
