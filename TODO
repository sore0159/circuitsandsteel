Impliment AI
	Simple AI for now, "Little Bobby Tables"
	More robust Gamestate-Snapshot feature (shelve, pickle?)
Bugtesting
	AI should help with bugtesting
Integrate game on web
	web.py? flask? Something else?
	probably need mysql or at least shelve integration for this
        check game_id on creation vs games in progress
Impliment Dragon
	Ignore Dragon Powers for now
Impliment Powers
	hooooo boy will this be a job
	Might necessitate (no spellchecker on vim!  look into that) total data structure rewrite
Total Data Structure Rewrite
	probably should do this anyway sometime, it's a mess in there
	for now, it works, don't break it
