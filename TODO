Run Script upgrades
	use the command line to test passing in args for choices
	update file write names for game id
	update script to use game id, player id args from bash
	graveyard display
Impliment AI
	Simple AI for now, "Little Bobby Tables"
	More robust Gamestate-Snapshot feature (shelve, pickle?)
Bugtesting
	AI should help with bugtesting
Temporal Display
	Some way to see a replay of the progress of the game from gamelog or snapshots
	just extended logstring printing for now I guess
Integrate game on web
	web.py? flask? Something else?
	probably need mysql or at least shelve integration for this
        check game_id on creation vs games in progress
Impliment Dragon
	Ignore Dragon Powers for now
Impliment Powers
	hooooo boy will this be a job
	Might necessitate (no spellchecker on vim!  look into that) total data structure rewrite
Total Data Structure Rewrite
	probably should do this anyway sometime, it's a mess in there
	for now, it works, don't break it
