Finish testing 2v2: Write up some test docs
Impliment Dragon
	Ignore Dragon Powers for now
Impliment AI
	Gamestate-Snapshot feature
	Simple AI for now, "Little Bobby Tables"
Integrate game on web
	web.py? flask? Something else?
	probably need mysql or at least shelve integration for this
Impliment Powers
	hooooo boy will this be a job
	Might necessitate (no spellchecker on vim!  look into that) total data structure rewrite
Total Data Structure Rewrite
	probably should do this anyway sometime, it's a mess in there
	for now, it works, don't break it
