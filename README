Python implimentation of Flash Duel
Split across several files for readability/editability, not for any functional reason.

1v1 working pretty well, 2v2 mostly through implimentation
TODO: AI implimentaiton, web page integration
TODO: Dragon implimentation, Powers implimentation (maybe)
TODO: Simplify base data structures, no need for all those objects and lists.  Maybe not worth messing with what works for now though.
