===================  CIRCUITS AND STEEL  ==================
Python implimentation of the board game Flash Duel/En Garde
Usage:
python run.py [gNUM[pNUM]] [CHOICE]

optional gNUM argument creates/loads a game of id NUM; without a game ID 0 is created/loaded.  g10 in particular will create a 1v1 game (at present).

Optional argument extension pNUM can follow a gNUM arg with no space, and will view the selected game from the veiw of the player with id NUM: if no such player exists a public veiw will be shown.  At present this doesn't interfere with making choices even if it's not the turn of your veiwpoint.

Optional CHOICE argument will attempt to have the current player make the selected choice.  No error for an invalid choice at present, just nothing happens.  CHOICE is the exact string presented in the option list.

Example:
python run.py g10p12 d522
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
pklprinter will view the archive files created by playing the game.
Usage:
./pklprinter data/PKLFILE.pkl

pklprinter will let you browse through the snapshots archived in the selected pklfile, starting with the last.  Runtime options include navigating through the snapshots, changing the view from an (a)scii printout of the game to the (d)ata represented openly.  

Finally you may (i)solate a particular snapshot into its own file, isolate.pkl, which is created/overwritten in the working directory.  If it is a master snapshot (not a limited player view), you can rename isolate.pkl to gNUM_archive.pkl and put it in the data directory to make it available for play starting at that point.

Split across several files for readability/editability, not for any functional reason.
This is a pretty amateur project, you may notice that.  Several very useful functions written halfway through means something works one way at one point and another way at other points!  Exciting.

1v1 and 2v2 basically working (No Powers)
First AI opponent, Little Bobby Tables, is operational!
More AI opponents working, but not really up to speed.
More robust AI to come
Web interface to come
Dragons and Powers much farther off
